This is a very simple project to demo building backend apps with
webpack. Download, run `webpack` and run `node build/backend.js` to
start the server.

This is meant to along with my posts. Each post corresponds to a branch:

* [Backend Apps with Webpack: Part I](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-I) - part1
* [Backend Apps with Webpack: Part II](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-II) - part2a and part2b
* [Backend Apps with Webpack: Part III](http://jlongster.com/Backend-Apps-with-Webpack--Part-III) - part3 (or master)
